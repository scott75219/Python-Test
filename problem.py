# Python Test

# You are given a matrix with m rows and n columns of cells, each of which
# contains either 1 or 0. Two cells are said to be connected if they are
# adjacent to each other horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The connected
# and filled (i.e. cells that contain a 1) cells form a region. There may be
# several regions in the matrix. Find the number of cells in the largest region
# in the matrix.

# Input Format 
# There will be three parts of the input:
# The first line will contain m, the number of rows in the matrix.
# The second line will contain n, the number of columns in the matrix.
# This will be followed by the matrix grid: the list of numbers that make up the matrix.

# Output Format 
# Print the length of the largest region in the given matrix.

# Constraints
# 0<m<10
# 0<n<10

# Sample Input:
# 4
# 4
# 1 1 0 0
# 0 1 1 0
# 0 0 1 0
# 1 0 0 0

# Sample Output:
# 5

# Explanation
# X X 0 0
# 0 X X 0
# 0 0 X 0
# 1 0 0 0
# The X characters indicate the largest connected component, as per the given
# definition. There are five cells in this component.

# Task: 
# Write the complete program to find the number of cells in the largest region.

# You will need to read from stdin for the input and write to stdout for the output
# If you are unfamiliar with what that means:
# raw_input is a function that reads from stdin
# print statements write to stdout
# You are not required to use raw_input or print statements, but it is the
# simplest and most common way to read and write to stdin/out

# The test cases are located in the test-cases directory.

# run-tests.py is not part of your test.  It is simply a convenience program
# that will test your code against all the test cases, one after another, and
# then tell you whether it passed or failed, and what the expected and actual
# outputs are.  You may review and modify run-tests.py as much as you want, but
# it will not score or lose you any points

# Included in the top level directory are four "hard" test cases that are
# square grids of side lengths 10, 25, 50, 100, and 1000 cells.  These were
# randomly generated using generate-hard-test-case.py, and they do not come
# with an expected output.  You may generate test cases of various dimensions
# using generate-test-case.py, but the ability of your algorithm to solve extra
# test cases you've created will not be considered in our evaluation of this
# test.  Your algorithm should be able to find a correct solution in a timely
# manner up to the 100x100 grid.  The 1000x1000 grid is "Extra Credit", as it
# were. If you work out an algorithm that can solve the 1000x1000 grid, but it
# takes more than 10 seconds to do so, please note that in a comment and let us
# know when you e-mail us your finished product.  All other test cases should
# take your algorithm no more than 3 seconds.

# Finally, you may not use third party libraries to complete this test.  You
# may only use the libraries available on a fresh Python 2.7 install.  I doubt
# you will need to use any libraries at all as this is just an algorithmic
# challenge.
